🎵 Music Recommendation System

A Music Recommendation System built using Machine Learning that suggests songs to users based on their listening habits, preferences, and song features. This project applies recommendation algorithms to deliver a personalized music discovery experience.

📝 Context

With millions of songs available on streaming platforms, users often struggle to find music that matches their tastes. This system leverages collaborative filtering and content-based filtering to recommend songs based on what similar users like, or by analyzing audio features such as genre, tempo, and mood.

It can be integrated into music platforms or apps to enhance user engagement and improve listening experiences.

⚡ Features

Personalized song recommendations for users.

Collaborative filtering (based on user-song ratings or play counts).

Content-based filtering (based on song attributes like genre, mood, tempo).

"If you like this song, you may also like..." suggestions.

Scalable and can work with large datasets like Spotify or Last.fm.

🛠 Technology Stack

Programming Language: Python

Libraries & Frameworks:

pandas, numpy – data processing

scikit-learn – machine learning models

surprise – collaborative filtering algorithms

spotipy – (optional) Spotify API integration

Flask / Streamlit (optional) – for deploying as a web app

🔮 Future Enhancements

Add hybrid recommendation system (mix of collaborative & content-based).

Integrate with Spotify API for real-time recommendations.

Enhance with deep learning models for mood-based playlists.

Build an interactive web app with personalized playlists.
